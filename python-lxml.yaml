Description: |
    lxml provides a Python binding to the libxslt and libxml2 libraries.
    It follows the ElementTree API as much as possible in order to provide
    a more Pythonic interface to libxml2 and libxslt than the default
    bindings.  In particular, lxml deals with Python Unicode strings
    rather than encoded UTF-8 and handles memory management automatically,
    unlike the default bindings.
